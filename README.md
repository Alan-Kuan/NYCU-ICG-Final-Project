# NYCU-ICG-Final-Project

This is my final project in the course, Introduction to Computer Graphics in NYCU.

I created a short animation with some effects made by geometry shaders. It features Pikachu playing a volley-pokeball with Eevee, and a later happened little accident... The full animation can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/1bnkBot6uj4).

Also, the project is created and built with Visual Studio 2019. If you're interested in it, you'll probably want to use it or later version to open the project and run it.
